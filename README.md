# Analyzing Network Performance and Security Vulnerabilities in Thermostats using iot data
 The project "Analyzing Network Performance and Security Vulnerabilities in Thermostats using IoT Data" focuses on evaluating the efficiency and security of smart thermostats. By collecting and analyzing real-time IoT data, we identified network performance issues, latency problems, and potential cybersecurity threats. The study involved detecting anomalies, unauthorized access attempts, and vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches. Machine learning techniques and statistical analysis were applied to enhance security measures and optimize device performance. The findings helped improve network reliability, mitigate cyber risks, and ensure the seamless operation of IoT-enabled thermostats, making them more efficient and secure for users.
